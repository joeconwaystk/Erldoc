Erldoc
======

A Mac OS X Erlang documentation browser.

Uses edoc and the included doc/src XML files to generate documentation to be displayed in Erldoc.

Requires that you have the Erlang source somewhere on your filesystem and use the in-application preferences to select where this directory is. (Note: not the directory that is installed into /usr/local/lib when you run make.)

It's ugly now, but it works pretty good. Supports searching. Will support adding your own files to the documentation browser in the future.
